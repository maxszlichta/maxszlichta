I'm interested in programming, game development, design, graphics, psychology, and mentoring. I'm currently studying at two universities simultaneously, which allows me to develop both hard and soft skills.

At 42Warsaw, I'm learning programming in a peer-to-peer model, where I manage my own learning path. I focus on developing technical skills through individual and group projects (mostly in C/C++), solving complex problems in the IT environment, and networking with other programming enthusiasts.

At the same time, I'm studying psychology in business at KoÅºmiÅ„ski University, where I work on my soft skills, such as communication, team management, and understanding human behavior in a business context. By combining these two areas, I gain a broader perspective on the modern world of work, business and IT.
